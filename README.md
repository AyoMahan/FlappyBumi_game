# FlappyBumi_game
Personal project to practice C# as well as the .Net framework for windows form
inspired by flappy bird. the game allows users to use the spacebar to keep the dog 
away from the pipes or the ground. A point is added to the score whenever the dog
passes by a pipe. The movement still feels a bit sluggish, looking to fix in the next commit.
